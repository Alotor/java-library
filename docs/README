To build the java-library docs, install ``sphinx`` and ``javasphinx``::

   pip install -r requirements.txt

Then build the javadoc data::

   javasphinx-apidoc -o . ../src/main/java/com/urbanairship/api/

And then finally build the HTML docs::

   make html

The theme is in a private submodule; if you don't have access to this, remove
the ``html_theme`` directive from ``conf.py``.
